        <h3>notes to future self</h3>
        <p>Keep building even when it feels uncomfortable. Every error message and late-night debug session 
        is making you a better engineer. Remember to complete every project you start and stay curious about how systems work under the hood. 
        The goal isn’t just to write software, but to <strong>solve real problems</strong> through it.</p>

            <h3>Extra thoughts </h3>

As a kid, she would spend hours in her brother’s room designing random projects in PowerPoint and playing around with envanto not knowing she was laying the foundation for her journey into the tech industry. She has remained a curious mind, always eager to learn and upgrade at any opportunity she gets and that curiousity has led and would continue to lead her to the path of greatness</p>
